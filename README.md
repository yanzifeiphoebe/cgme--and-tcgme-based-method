# cgme--and-tcgme-based-method
hybcgme_test1 and hybcgme_testinner can produce all the tables and figures in the paper.
Because hybcgme_test1 and hybcgme_testinner use the test problems from regu and RestoreTools which are from P.C.Hanson(http://www2.compute.dtu.dk/~pcha/),
and regu has been uploaded, RestoreTools should be downloaded first. RestoreTools too large to upload.
