# cgme--and-tcgme-based-method
The scripts hybcgme_test1 and hybcgme_testinner can generate all the tables and figures presented in the paper.
These scripts use test problems from the Regu() package (available at http://www2.compute.dtu.dk/~pcha/) and RestoreTools(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780123965011000078) by P.C. Hanson (available at http://www2.compute.dtu.dk/~pcha/).
Since the Regu package has already been uploaded, users should download RestoreTools separately, as it is too large to be included in the repository.
